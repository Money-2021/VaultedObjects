ITS Proof including KMS-Medley...

1. P(M = mIC = c) = P(M = m) i.e. seeing a ciphertext doesn't give you any extra information about the plaintext. The probability of seeing a message m after the ciphertext has been observed is the same as the probability of the message without the ciphertext.
2. P(C = cIM = mo) = P(C = cIM = mt ) i.e. the probability of ciphertext c is equally likely for 2 different messages. 
3. The key is as long as the message and a key should be used uniquely with a probability 1/IKI where IKI is the key space. 
Pr[M=m;C=c]=Pr[M=m] 

The knowledge of the Cyphertext is not helpful at all!
The result is independent of the capability of any attacker or computational resources.
The Vernam Cipher as implemented above is provably secure against all attacks.

Malleability and active attack vectors
Yet another issue has to be considered, namely the message authentication, which is not usually implemented in Vernam Ciphers.
Malleability is common to all stream ciphers (Hanaoka, 2008). Also, the XOR operator is vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack, since XOR (plaintext, ciphertext) = key.
Active attackers can also modify messages in transit, a weakness shared with all stream ciphers.
The ITS solution adds a propriewtry athentication to each key to addresses these well known issue.

Lastley Keys
Cryptographic keys should generally be generated secretly and uniformly at random in the cryptosystem's key domain; that is in the set of valid keys for the cryptosystem. What makes a key valid depends on the cryptosystem and often parameters (typically including key size).
Since the adversary may know how our system works (Kerckhoffs's principle), we need to find a way to generate keys that don't only depend on a deterministic computation (which the adversary could reproduce). Therefore, all keys must depend on something that the adversary does not know. Such a thing is called a “true” random value.
The proprietary KMS-Medley Key generator (KG) takes a TRNG seed and produces a secure cryptographic normalised True Random Number Generator (TRNG) key,  with a uniform distribution, meaning each bit in the key sequence is equally likely to occur. 

Conclusion 
The Medley ITS-KMS creats a pairwise, infinate length, identical secure key stream (all bits os the key have equal propablity) between two secure Identoity end points according to this proof.

Notes
1. The Medly Key Generation Cipher, is designed to remove the need for reciptical lists (Bellaso table), as used within the NSA DIANA cipher (Bellaso + Vernam = DIANA). 
2. The Medly  Key Generation Cipher is provably immune from all forms of atatck vectors as all keys are propvably secure. 
3. Medley cipher is essential the XOR (vernam cipher) of two TRNG key streams.
