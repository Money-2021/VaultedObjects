ITS Proof including KMS-Medley...

1. P(M = mIC = c) = P(M = m) i.e. seeing a ciphertext doesn't give you any extra information about the plaintext. The probability of seeing a message m after the ciphertext has been observed is the same as the probability of the message without the ciphertext.
2. P(C = cIM = mo) = P(C = cIM = mt ) i.e. the probability of ciphertext c is equally likely for 2 different messages. 
3. The key is as long as the message and a key should be used uniquely with a probability 1/IKI where IKI is the key space. 
Pr[M=m;C=c]=Pr[M=m] 

The knowledge of the Cyphertext is not helpful at all!
The result is independent of the capability of any attacker or computational resources.
The Vernam Cipher as implemented above is provably secure against all attacks.

Malleability
Yet another issue has to be considered, namely the message authentication, which is not usually implemented in one-time pads.
Malleability is common to all stream ciphers (Hanaoka, 2008). Also, the XOR operator is vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack, since XOR (plaintext, ciphertext) = key.
The ITS solution has a propriewtry athentication algorthim which addresses theis known issue.
