Once the secrets of the algorithm’s implementation are discovered (as they often are), systems using these algorithms become vulnerable to attack. 
That’s why, according to Kerckhoffs’s Principle, the only secret element of an encryption algorithm should be the key itself.

Encryption keys are a fundamental component of the security of cryptographic systems and should be strongly protected. 
In order to properly protect your encryption key, you’ll need a key management system.

The security of the Valuted Object KMS is foundational to the security of the Vaulted Object framwork.

THE FRAMEWORK
The valuted object KMS is a proprietry system protected as a Trade Secret, contained within a hardware protected trust zone.
The solution is quantium safe as a brute force attack on the KMS would thereticlaly take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently about 1.38×10^10 years old.

KMS Principles

1. A cryptosystem should be secure, even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. This concept is widely embraced by cryptographers, in contrast to security through obscurity, which is not.
2. There exists no form of key storage within any element of the KMS. All keys are generated on demand using a proven key Generator with at least 40 years of operational experience.
3. All KG seed or keying material travels within a trusted path, and is protected to the same level as any generated key material.
4. Within the KMS key material is never stored (ever) and always moves external to any key usage channel.
5. There exist no centralised key storage of management system, all keys are generated or regenerated via decentralised KG process.
6. All generated keys have a security policy which requires single usage or at most has an ephemeral existence for the duration of a the vaulting system.
7. All KG's domains are segregated via the use of domain specific universals, there exist no interoperability between KMS domains or KG's.
8. There exist no public key based algorithms used within the KMS, hence deriving private leys from public keys must not be an attack vector for any KMS.
 

Notes
1. According to "Distinguisher and Related-Key Attack on the Full AES-256 (Extended Version)", the current best estimate of difficultity is 2^231.
But the best one can say aboutr any encryption system is that to the best of ones knowledge there exist no knowen public atatck on AES256, 
this doe snot means that no attack vector exists just that there exist no known practical exploits today. 
2. Cryptographical advancement (that allows an attacker to recover the plaintext without trying all possible keys); this is an open question.
 I personally don't expect a total break; that is, something that, given a reasonable amount of ciphertext (and possibly some known plaintext),
 will allow them to decrypt; I wouldn't be that shocked if someone in the next hundred years found a theoretical break (e.g. O(2^150) effort given vast mounds of chosen plaintext).
3. The history and usage of KG's is derived from the theorically secure One-Time-Pad. The fist mass deployed KG-84 was developed in 1983 and was first introduced in early 1984.
The keyig of each KG was a manual process via a secure KYK-13 device.
