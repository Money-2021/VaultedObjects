Once the secrets of the algorithm’s implementation are discovered (as they often are), systems using these algorithms become vulnerable to attack. 
That’s why, according to Kerckhoffs’s Principle, the only secret element of an encryption algorithm should be the key itself.

Encryption keys are a fundamental component of the security of cryptographic systems and should be strongly protected. 
In order to properly protect your encryption key, you’ll need a key management system.

The security of the Valuted Object KMS is foundational to the security of the Vaulted Object framwork.

THE FRAMEWORK
The valuted object KMS is a proprietry system protected as a Trade Secret, contained within a hardware protected trust zone.
The solution is quantium safe as a brute force attack on the KMS would thereticlaly take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently about 1.38×10^10 years old.

KMS Principles
1. A cryptosystem should be secure, even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. This concept is widely embraced by cryptographers, in contrast to security through obscurity, which is not.
2. There exists no key key storage within any element of the KMS. All keys are generated on demand using a proven key Generator with at least 40 yeasr of operational experience.
3. All KG seed material travel within a trusted path and are protected to the same level as any generated key material.
4. Within the KMS key material is never stored and always moves external to any key usage channel.
5. There exist no centralised key storage of management system, all keys are generaated or regenerated via decentralised pprocess.
6. All KGs have a policy of single usage or at most exist for the duration of a vaulting systen.
7. All KG's domains are segregated via the use of doamin spcific universals, there exist no interoperablity between KMS domains or KG's.
  

Notes
1. According to "Distinguisher and Related-Key Attack on the Full AES-256 (Extended Version)", the current best estimate of difficultity is 2^231.
But the best one can say aboutr any encryption system is that to the best of ones knowledge there exist no knowen public atatck on AES256, 
this doe snot means that no attack vector exists just that there exist no known practical exploits today.
